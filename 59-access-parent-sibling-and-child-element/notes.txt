we can get access  eny parent of element by "element.parentElement" and also get parent of this by
"element.parentElement.parentElement".
if we does furthur paranetElement.parentElement then we react at final element which is "HTML".
After HTML we will get "null".For futhur find parent of element we should check ".parentNode" then we will
get "document".It means that our html is in document object.
document is a parent node.
if we does .childNodes then i give NodeList[] which contain child nodes e.g texts and elements etc .if we does .children then i gives HTML collection[], which give inner  html elements.length of nodes html parennt elements  may equal or more that childElements.
Note: Every element is a node, but not every node is an element. Other nodes include text nodes and comment nodes.
If an elements has four child elements, its each child element has siblings. for eample has 4 sibings like paragraph has 4 siblings 1)b 2)a 3)a 4)a 5)a then i we are on first sibling then we have obtion of next sibling .nextSibling and 2,3,4, we has both .nextSibling and .previousElementSibling.and 5 has only 
.previousElementSibling.if not find sibling then i give null.
note:- if we get childElements then it gives only elements,if we childNodes then it give all elements and text,also comment  in NodeList.

.nextElementSibling give us only element sibling and .nextSibling give us whole element,comments,texts every thing.

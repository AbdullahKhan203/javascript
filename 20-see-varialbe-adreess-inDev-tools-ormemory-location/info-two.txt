Q:- Exaplle of code does not clean from memory and how to clearn up properly?

# Understanding system/Context and Garbage Collection in JavaScript

## 1️⃣ What is system/Context in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, **system/Context** represents a special execution environment created by the JavaScript engine (like Chrome’s V8). It holds variables, functions, and closures when they are still accessible and referenced somewhere in your code.

When you see something like this in the Memory tab in DevTools:
```
name in system/Context@12345
```
It means:
- **name**: The variable being stored.
- **system/Context**: The environment where this variable is kept alive.
- **@12345**: A unique memory address identifying this specific context.

This context often shows up when:
- Variables are **tied to closures**.
- **Event listeners** reference variables that haven’t been cleaned up.
- **Global objects** retain their references.

## 2️⃣ How system/Context Works: Code Example

Let’s take a closure example:

```javascript
function outer() {
    let name = "Alice"; // Captured by the closure
    return function inner() {
        console.log(name); // 'inner' keeps 'name' alive
    };
}

const myFunc = outer(); // 'name' stays in memory because of the closure
myFunc();
```

What’s happening here:
- `outer()` creates a variable `name`.
- `inner()` captures `name` in a closure.
- As long as `myFunc` references `inner`, the `name` variable stays in memory.

In DevTools > Memory > Heap Snapshot, you’ll see:
```
name in system/Context@56789
```

## 3️⃣ How to Clean Up and Trigger Garbage Collection

When we remove the reference to `inner()`, the closure and the `name` variable can finally be garbage collected.

```javascript
myFunc = null; // Removing the reference to 'inner'
```

Now:
- `inner` function is no longer accessible.
- `name` is no longer referenced and can be cleaned up.

If you take a **heap snapshot** and search for `"Alice"`, it won’t appear because the memory has been freed.

## 4️⃣ Real-World Example: Event Listener and Memory Leak

Let’s see how an event listener can cause a memory leak:

```javascript
let button = document.getElementById("myButton");

function handleClick() {
    console.log("Button clicked!");
}

button.addEventListener("click", handleClick);

// Later, we remove the button but forget the listener
document.body.removeChild(button);
```

**What happens:**
- `button` is removed from the DOM.
- But `handleClick` still references the button in memory.
- `button` and its listener stay in memory — **causing a memory leak**.

**Fixing the memory leak:**

```javascript
button.removeEventListener("click", handleClick);
button = null; // Now the button and listener can be garbage collected
```

Once we remove the listener and clear the reference, both the button and the function become eligible for garbage collection.

## 5️⃣ How to Debug with DevTools

1. **Open DevTools:** Go to Memory > Take Heap Snapshot.
2. **Search for Variables:** Look for strings like `"Alice"` or object names.
3. **Check Retainers:** See what’s keeping them alive.
4. **Clean Up:** Ensure you remove event listeners and clear closures when no longer needed.

---

## 6️⃣ Final Thoughts

- `system/Context` keeps variables alive when still referenced.
- Closures and event listeners are common causes of memory leaks.
- Properly removing references helps garbage collection do its job.
- Use DevTools to monitor memory usage and avoid leaks.

Q:-So what type of code that are successsfuly remove after execution of code?
Ans:-In JavaScript, variables, functions, and objects are successfully removed from memory (garbage collected) after execution when there are **no remaining references** to them. Let‚Äôs break down what kind of code gets cleaned up and why:

### ‚úÖ Successfully Removed After Execution:
1. **Local Variables in Functions**  
   When a function finishes execution and no closures capture its variables:
   
   ```javascript
   function sayHello() {
       let greeting = "Hello, World!";
       console.log(greeting);
   }

   sayHello();
   // 'greeting' is no longer accessible and gets garbage collected
   ```

2. **Unreferenced Objects**  
   If an object becomes unreachable, it‚Äôs cleaned up:

   ```javascript
   let user = { name: "Alice" };
   user = null; // The 'Alice' object is now unreferenced and gets cleaned up
   ```

3. **Event Listeners Properly Removed**  
   When event listeners are detached, their references are cleared:

   ```javascript
   let button = document.getElementById("myButton");

   function handleClick() {
       console.log("Button clicked!");
   }

   button.addEventListener("click", handleClick);

   button.removeEventListener("click", handleClick);
   button = null; // Both button and listener are now eligible for garbage collection
   ```

4. **Temporary Variables**  
   Variables inside block scopes (`let` and `const`) that aren‚Äôt returned or captured by closures:

   ```javascript
   {
       let temp = "I'm temporary";
   }
   // 'temp' is cleaned up after the block executes
   ```

### ‚ùå Not Removed and Stays in Memory:
1. **Global Variables**  
   Variables declared in the global scope remain until the page is closed or refreshed:

   ```javascript
   var globalVar = "I live forever";
   ```

2. **Captured by Closures**  
   Variables kept alive by functions that reference them:

   ```javascript
   function outer() {
       let name = "Bob";
       return function inner() {
           console.log(name); // 'name' stays in memory due to closure
       };
   }

   const myFunc = outer();
   ```

3. **Detached DOM Elements with Listeners**  
   If you forget to remove event listeners before removing an element from the DOM:

   ```javascript
   let div = document.createElement("div");

   function onClick() {
       console.log("Clicked!");
   }

   div.addEventListener("click", onClick);
   document.body.removeChild(div); // 'div' and 'onClick' stay in memory
   ```

**In short:**  
Code that‚Äôs **no longer referenced anywhere** gets cleaned up. But **closures, global variables, and attached event listeners** often keep memory from being freed ‚Äî that‚Äôs when **system/Context** retains them. Let me know if you want me to dive deeper into any of these! üöÄ

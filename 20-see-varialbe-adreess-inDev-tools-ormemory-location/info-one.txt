- Itâ€™s where **variables, functions, and closures are stored** â€” especially when theyâ€™re still **referenced** and **accessible** somewhere in your code.  
- This context often shows up when variables are **tied to global objects** (like `window`), **closures**, or **event listeners** that havenâ€™t been cleaned up.
 if this mean when our code run,after the memory clearn up, but these are not cleaned?
 Ans:-Exactly â€” youâ€™re right! Letâ€™s clarify this step by step.  

When JavaScript runs, the **garbage collector (GC)** automatically cleans up **variables, functions, and objects** from memory when theyâ€™re **no longer accessible** â€” meaning no part of your code still references them.  

But when you see variables in **"system/Context"** in the **Memory tab** after cleanup, it means:  

1. **They havenâ€™t been cleaned up because something still references them**.  
2. **JavaScriptâ€™s garbage collector can only clean up memory when there are no more references to an object**.  
3. **system/Context holds onto variables, functions, and closures if theyâ€™re still accessible somewhere in your code** â€” even if you think they should be gone.  

**For example:**  

```javascript
function outer() {
    let name = "Alice"; // Captured by the closure
    return function inner() {
        console.log(name); // 'inner' keeps 'name' alive
    };
}

const myFunc = outer(); // 'name' is still accessible through 'myFunc'
```

- Even after `outer()` finishes running, the `name` variable **isn't cleaned up**.  
- Why? Because the `inner` function **still has access to it** via the closure.  
- So the `name` variable stays in memory inside **system/Context**.  

**When would this become a memory leak?**  

If you **keep creating closures** or **attaching event listeners** without removing them, those variables stick around â€” even when they **should have been garbage collected**.  

```javascript
let button = document.getElementById("myButton");

function handleClick() {
    console.log("Button clicked!");
}

// Even after removing the button from the DOM, 'handleClick' keeps it in memory
button.addEventListener("click", handleClick);
document.body.removeChild(button); 
```

Here, even after the button is gone from the page, it **stays in memory** because the `handleClick` function **still references it**.  

**How to fix it:**  
```javascript
button.removeEventListener("click", handleClick);
button = null; // Now the button and its listener can be garbage collected
```

So when you see variables in **system/Context** after memory cleanup, it often means:  
- Thereâ€™s still **some reference to them** somewhere in your code.  
- JavaScript **canâ€™t clean them up** because theyâ€™re **still accessible** from some function, object, or listener.

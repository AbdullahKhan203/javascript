Q:-why we can't spread object as argument during function call?
Ans:-When you say we **can’t spread an object as an argument during a function call**, that’s not entirely true — we *can* spread an object, but it depends on how the function is defined and what kind of arguments it expects.

Let’s break down how it works.

If you have an object like this:

```javascript
const user = { name: 'Alice', age: 25 };
```

You **can spread it** when calling a function that expects separate named parameters:

```javascript
function greet(name, age) {
  console.log(`Hello, my name is ${name} and I'm ${age} years old.`);
}

greet(...user); // ❌ This will throw an error!
```

Why does this throw an error? Because the **spread operator (`...`) works on iterable objects like arrays, not plain objects**. `user` is an object, not an array, so JavaScript won’t know how to spread it into individual arguments.

But if the function expects an **object**, you **can** spread the object like this:

```javascript
function greet({ name, age }) {
  console.log(`Hello, my name is ${name} and I'm ${age} years old.`);
}

greet({ ...user }); // ✅ This works perfectly!
```

Here, we’re still spreading the object, but into another object — which works fine, and the function accepts it as an object parameter.

If you really wanted to pass object properties as separate arguments, you could do this:

```javascript
greet(...Object.values(user)); // 🚨 This works, but order matters!
```

Or even:

```javascript
greet(user.name, user.age); // ✅ Clear and direct
```

**So the key points are:**

- The spread operator works on arrays and iterable objects when spreading into function arguments.
- If a function expects named parameters (like `name`, `age`), an object can’t be spread directly.
- You can spread an object into another object if the function expects a single object parameter.

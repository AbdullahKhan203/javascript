 Q:what is diff b/w visibility:hidden and opacity:0?
 Ans:-visibility: hidden and opacity: 0 are both CSS properties used to hide elements, but they work differently:

visibility: hidden: The element is hidden, but it still takes up space in the layout. It is not visible, but it is still part of the document flow.

opacity: 0: The element is fully transparent (invisible), but it still takes up space in the layout and can still interact with events (like clicks).

Here's an example to illustrate the difference:
e.g:-
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
.hidden {
  visibility: hidden;
}

.transparent {
  opacity: 0;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<p class="hidden">This paragraph is hidden but still takes up space.</p>
<p class="transparent">This paragraph is transparent but still takes up space and can be interacted with.</p>

</body>
</html>
In summary:

visibility: hidden hides the element but keeps its space.
opacity: 0 makes the element invisible but keeps its space and interactivity.


note:- textContent and innerText have more difference.

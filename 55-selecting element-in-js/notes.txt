getting elements by like .children[0].children[0] is very difficult.we can get it by 
document.getElementsByTagName('img') and ans in the form of HTMLCollection(3) [img, img, img].
document also has by default property document.images
when we get elements by  document.getElementsByTagName('h2') it gives use elements in array which we can get 
by indexing document.getElementsByTagName('h2')[0]. This thing give us elements as HTMLCollection like this:- 
HTMLCollection(3)Â [img, img, img]
we can also add any element a class like```  
<img
      src="./html-css-javascript.png"
      alt="html-css-javascript"
      style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px"
      title="Frontend Roadmap"
      class="css-image"
    />```and get it by ```document.getElementsByClassName("css-image").
    we can also get multiple elements by adding same class on multiple.

    document.querySelector is better than three like class,id or tag.
    document.querySelector("#css-image").
    document.querySelector("") always return single element only which it finds first.
    we can also find accorfing to tag name ```document.querySelector("div");``` with querySelector.
    document.querySelectorAll(".css-image") give us all elements but in NodeList[] not in HTMLCollection.


what is diff b/w nodeList and HTMLCollection in dom object?
Ans:-Here are the key differences between NodeList and HTMLCollection in the DOM:

Type of Elements:

NodeList: Can contain any type of nodes (elements, text nodes, comments, etc.).
HTMLCollection: Contains only element nodes.
Live vs Static:

NodeList: Can be either live or static. For example, document.querySelectorAll returns a static NodeList, while Node.childNodes returns a live NodeList.
HTMLCollection: Always live, meaning it automatically updates when the document changes.
Access Methods:

NodeList: Can be accessed using an index (like an array) and has a forEach method.
HTMLCollection: Can be accessed using an index (like an array) and also by the element's name or id.
Conversion:

Both NodeList and HTMLCollection can be converted to an array using Array.from() or the spread operator [...collection].
Example:
// NodeList example
const nodeList = document.querySelectorAll('div');
nodeList.forEach(node => console.log(node));

// HTMLCollection example
const htmlCollection = document.getElementsByClassName('example');
Array.from(htmlCollection).forEach(element => console.log(element));

In summary, NodeList is more general and can contain different types of nodes, while HTMLCollection is specific to element nodes and is always live.

we can directly use array methods in nodeList but in htmlCollection first we convert it into array with Array.from(htmlCollection).


We can also add query selector in particular element instead of document.querySelector 
e.g:-

const ul=document.querySelector("ul")
console.log("ul",ul)
console.log(ul.querySelector("ol"))

We can also find other metods like getElementsByClassName or getElementsByTagName in small elements object but not getElementById.
e.g:- 

console.log(ul.getElementsByClassName(".para"))
console.log(ul.getElementsByTagName("<p>"))

we can also get address of any element of DOM with 
click on any element in elements tab which is left console and right click on particular element
element>copy>copy JS path. by click on this we can get copy of any element in dom which is provided by browser.

global scope is found in two catagories:-
1)global(window) scope Object(global and window objects are same) 2)Script scope object
note:- we can check shope in console developer tools tab source.
Those variable are crated by let and const are shifted in script scope object.Script scope is also a  global scope.
But variabel created by use of var found in global or window scope.

note:- for better undersanding we can say thay glocal socpe containes two script scope and window scope.
the variable which are in global scope would be excessable in whole page.
note:- we can stop execution of code with debugger keyword.
the function which we write in page can be excessable in window object like window.sayHi().
But the variabels which are in script are not excessable with like window.username give undefined.
But both are global scope variables.

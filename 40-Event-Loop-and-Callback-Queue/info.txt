What is Event Loop and Callback Queue in js?
Ans:-In JavaScript, the **Event Loop** and **Callback Queue** are part of the system that manages how asynchronous operations work â€” like fetching data, reading files, or handling user input â€” while keeping JavaScript single-threaded. Letâ€™s break them down:  

**Event Loop:**  
The event loop is a mechanism that coordinates the execution of different pieces of JavaScript code â€” like callbacks, promises, and other asynchronous code â€” by continuously checking if the **Call Stack** is empty and if there are any pending callbacks in the **Callback Queue**.  

It works like this:  
1. JavaScript runs synchronous code first and pushes function calls onto the **Call Stack** (which is a LIFO structure).  
2. When asynchronous code like `setTimeout`, Promises, or HTTP requests are encountered, they are offloaded to Web APIs or other background tasks.  
3. Once those tasks finish, their associated callback functions are sent to the **Callback Queue** (or **Microtask Queue** for promises).  
4. The event loop continuously checks if the **Call Stack** is empty â€” only when it's empty, it takes the next function from the **Callback Queue** and pushes it onto the **Call Stack** for execution.  
5. This cycle keeps going, ensuring non-blocking execution in JavaScript.  

**Callback Queue:**  
The callback queue holds the callback functions waiting to be executed after asynchronous operations complete. For example, if you use `setTimeout`, the function you pass will end up in the callback queue after the specified time.  

Thereâ€™s also a **Microtask Queue** (also called the **Job Queue**) that has higher priority â€” callbacks from Promises and `process.nextTick()` (in Node.js) go here and are executed before the normal callback queue.  

**Letâ€™s see a quick example:**  

```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Timeout callback");
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("Promise callback");
});

console.log("End");
```

**Output:**  
```
Start  
End  
Promise callback  
Timeout callback  
```

**Why this order?**  
- `Start` and `End` are synchronous and run first.  
- The Promise callback goes into the **Microtask Queue** and is executed right after synchronous code finishes.  
- The `setTimeout` callback goes into the **Callback Queue** and runs only after the call stack and the microtask queue are both clear.  

So the **Event Loop** is what makes sure JavaScript handles asynchronous code without blocking, and the **Callback Queue** (along with the Microtask Queue) determines the order in which callbacks get executed.  

Let me know if youâ€™d like me to dive deeper into any of these concepts!  

Q:Understanding in detail?
Ans:-Alright â€” letâ€™s really dig into this!  

**JavaScript's Single-Threaded Nature:**  
JavaScript runs in a single-threaded environment, meaning it has **one call stack** and can only execute **one piece of code at a time**. This might make you wonder how JavaScript can handle things like:  
- **Timers** (`setTimeout`, `setInterval`)  
- **HTTP Requests** (`fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest`)  
- **DOM Events** (like `click`, `keydown`)  
- **Promises** and `async/await`  

The secret sauce? Itâ€™s the **Event Loop**, **Callback Queue**, and **Web APIs** â€” all of which work together to manage asynchronous behavior while keeping JavaScript non-blocking.  

---

**Letâ€™s break down the key players:**  

1. **Call Stack:**  
   - This is where JavaScript keeps track of function calls.  
   - It follows **LIFO** (Last In, First Out).  
   - Every time you call a function, it gets pushed onto the stack. Once it finishes execution, it gets popped off.  

2. **Web APIs:**  
   - These are provided by the browser (like DOM, `setTimeout`, `fetch`, etc.) or Node.js (like filesystem or HTTP requests).  
   - When you call `setTimeout`, for example, the browser takes over the timer functionality â€” JavaScript itself just hands it off.  
   - Once the Web API finishes its task (like the timer expires or the HTTP response comes back), it sends the callback to the **Callback Queue** (or sometimes the **Microtask Queue**, weâ€™ll get there).  

3. **Callback Queue:**  
   - When a Web API finishes an asynchronous task, it sends the callback function to this queue.  
   - Examples: Callbacks from `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, or event listeners end up here.  
   - The **Event Loop** picks up functions from the callback queue and moves them to the call stack â€” but only when the **call stack is empty**.  

4. **Microtask Queue (Job Queue):**  
   - Higher priority than the callback queue!  
   - Promises and `process.nextTick()` (in Node.js) send their callbacks here.  
   - The event loop always empties the microtask queue **before** moving on to the callback queue.  

5. **Event Loop:**  
   - The traffic cop of JavaScriptâ€™s asynchronous model.  
   - It constantly checks:  
     - "Is the **call stack** empty?"  
     - "Are there any pending functions in the **microtask queue**?"  
     - "Are there any pending functions in the **callback queue**?"  
   - Only when the call stack is empty does it push functions from these queues onto the stack.  
   - Microtask queue gets priority â€” it empties before the callback queue runs.  

---

**Letâ€™s watch it in action with a detailed example:**  

```javascript
console.log("1: Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("2: Timeout callback");
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("3: Promise callback");
});

console.log("4: End");
```

**What happens, step by step:**  
1. `console.log("1: Start")` â†’ Sync â†’ Goes on the **call stack**, executes, logs "1: Start", pops off.  
2. `setTimeout` â†’ Async â†’ Web API sets a **0ms timer** and offloads it. The callback waits in the background.  
3. `Promise.resolve().then(...)` â†’ Microtask â†’ The callback for `.then()` goes to the **microtask queue**.  
4. `console.log("4: End")` â†’ Sync â†’ Goes on the **call stack**, executes, logs "4: End", pops off.  
5. **Event Loop:**  
   - Call stack is empty â†’ It checks the **microtask queue**.  
   - The promise callback `"3: Promise callback"` moves to the **call stack**, executes, and pops off.  
6. **Event Loop:**  
   - Call stack is empty again â†’ Now it checks the **callback queue**.  
   - The `setTimeout` callback `"2: Timeout callback"` moves to the **call stack**, executes, and pops off.  

**Final Output:**  
```
1: Start  
4: End  
3: Promise callback  
2: Timeout callback  
```

**Why does the promise go before the timeout even with 0ms delay?**  
Because **microtasks always have priority** over the callback queue! This behavior ensures that promise-based tasks execute right after synchronous code, but before other queued callbacks.  

---

**Letâ€™s go even deeper with nested callbacks:**  

```javascript
console.log("A");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("B");

  Promise.resolve().then(() => {
    console.log("C");
  });
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("D");
});

console.log("E");
```

**Step-by-Step Execution:**  
1. `"A"` â†’ Sync â†’ Logs immediately.  
2. `setTimeout` â†’ Web API â†’ Offloads the callback.  
3. `Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("D"))` â†’ Microtask â†’ Queues `"D"` in the microtask queue.  
4. `"E"` â†’ Sync â†’ Logs immediately.  
5. **Event Loop:**  
   - Call stack empty â†’ Checks **microtask queue**.  
   - `"D"` â†’ Logs `"D"`, pops off.  
6. **Event Loop:**  
   - Call stack empty â†’ Checks **callback queue**.  
   - `setTimeout` callback â†’ Moves to **call stack**, logs `"B"`.  
7. Inside the `setTimeout` callback â†’ `Promise.resolve().then()` â†’ Adds `"C"` to the **microtask queue**.  
8. `"B"` callback finishes, pops off.  
9. **Event Loop:**  
   - Call stack empty â†’ Checks **microtask queue**.  
   - `"C"` â†’ Logs `"C"`, pops off.  

**Final Output:**  
```
A  
E  
D  
B  
C  
```

**Recap:**  
- **Call Stack:** Executes synchronous code.  
- **Web APIs:** Handle async tasks like timers, HTTP requests, DOM events.  
- **Microtask Queue:** For promises and `process.nextTick()`, has **higher priority**.  
- **Callback Queue:** For `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and event callbacks.  
- **Event Loop:** Decides what to execute next by checking if the call stack is clear.

Event simulators in JavaScript are ways to programmatically trigger events on DOM elements â€” just like how a user would click, type, or interact with the page. Instead of waiting for an actual user action, you can simulate those actions through code. This is super useful for testing, automation, and dynamic behavior.

for example:-
         in this code 
         ```addCardBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
    const newCard = document.createElement('div')
    newCard.classList.add('card')
    newCard.innerText = count++
    container.append(newCard)
})
```

if we want to print 1000 cards manually we can run code
```for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
    addCardBtn.click()
    
}``` to print 1000 times through programmatically insted of manually click.

if we want that card add slowly we can watch watch adding caaards then we can run code:-

setInterval(()=>{
    addCardBtn.click()
},500)
2 cards print in one second.

we can stop this after cetain prints with this function:-
let intervalId=setInterval(()=>{
    if(count>=51){
        // count++;
        clearInterval(intervalId)
    }
    addCardBtn.click()
},1);



similarly, we can focus input field with focus simulator:-

Hoisting is like getting excess any variable or function before declaration, if give us not any error and run  correctly,it is called hoisting.
Like we have read in memory creation phase, all variables assing undefined,before code execution phase.
for example we excess variable before declaration like:-
console.log(username); // undefined
const username="ali";

note:-if we use var then our variable would go in global scope object according to memory creation phase.In case of const it i our variable display in script scope.

Successfully histing is done with var, not possible with let,const.JS add variable in temporal dead zone with let,const.
Hoisting is also done with let,const but js add that variable in temporal dead zone,so we can not excess that variable.

Q:-What is temporal dead zone (TDZ)?
And:-In JavaScript, a temporal dead zone (TDZ) is the period of time when a variable is declared but not yet initialized. During this time, the variable cannot be accessed and will throw a ReferenceError if used. 

Functions,classess in js are hoisted properly.
There are two ways to create a function :-
1. function sayHi(){

}
sayHi() is called function declaration
2.var sayHi=function(){

}
var sayHi is called function expression.But both are also called function defination.
If we declarate function with expression, then our function is not hoistable but our varible show undefined which show that it will hoistable.When we declare functionwith expression then this parat:-
function(){

} is called anonymous function.


note:- some time we create anonymous function and not declare them any name, this concept is called IIFE function.IIFE stand for immediatey invoked function expression.
An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) in JavaScript is a function thatâ€™s defined and executed immediately after its creation. It looks like this:

(function() {
    console.log("This is an IIFE!");
})();

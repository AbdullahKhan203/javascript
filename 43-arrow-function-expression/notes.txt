there are three type of ways to make a function 
1) with function keyword 
function add(){

}
2)with expression
const add=function(){

}
3)arraww function
const add=(a,b)=>{return a+b}
but we can short this like:-
const add=(a,b)=>a+b   // called implicit return.
since we does not declare function word in array function,so basically it is an expression.
this is also a valid way to make arrow function :-
const add=()=>(
    Math.randow(Math.random+1)*10
    )

note:- arrow function is common for passing function as a calbacks.

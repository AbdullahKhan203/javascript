event bubbling is that when we apply events in child and fire event on child elements, then it fires whole events of its parent if its parent have event.
for example in this code:-
<div class="green">
        <div class="red">
            <div class="blue">

            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    if we apply event on blue, then if ren and green have event, then its parent(red,green) run by default.this process of run event till blue<red<green<document<window.this is called bubbling.if we  fired event on child, then its whole parent's events run automatically,if they have event on them.
    like if we throw a stone on center of swimming pool its wave spread until it reaches on the edges of pool.we can stop this wave by using e.wventPropagation().

    for example if we have this code :-
    ```
    let green=document.querySelector('.green')
let red=document.querySelector('.red')
let blue=document.querySelector('.blue')



window.addEventListener('click',()=>{
    console.log('window is clieked');
    
})
document.addEventListener('click',()=>{
    console.log('document is clieked');
    
})
document.body.addEventListener('click',()=>{
    console.log('body is clieked');
    
})
green.addEventListener('click',()=>{
    console.log('green is clieked');
    
})
red.addEventListener('click',()=>{
    console.log('red is clieked');
    
})
blue.addEventListener('click',()=>{
    console.log('blue is clieked');
    
})
``` and if we fire event on child blue. the its parent by default running like if we click on blue event then its whole event run and console.log is :-
```
blue is clieked
script.js:24 red is clieked
script.js:20 green is clieked
script.js:16 body is clieked
script.js:12 document is clieked
script.js:8 window is clieked```
all existing fired from child to parent(blue<red<green<body<document<window).this is  called bubbling.
we can stop this by applying e.stopPropagation();. this is because it stops spreading event.

Event Caturing:-
          Event Caturing is opposite of Bubbling.in event bubbling event hapening start form parent to child(on which event is fired).but Condition is that its parent have events.



 note:- if we apply sequence in which some work according capturing phase and some according to bubbling, then its sequence change according to it.
